			<h1>Sample Company Name</h1>

		In the video below, you'll see that I used the video provided by Professor Cardenas. The Video appears to be a screen recording from what the viewer could assume is her canvas home page with an email open, ready to compose. The email is quickly closed in this short video and the viewers eyes can dart about and wonder about the tabs at the bottom. It's important to note that the student working on this project has the video looping, yet when controls were added, the video would not loop, it was noted that the cause for this was the ">" character. When removed, the video looped AND controls were present.
