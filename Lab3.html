		Hi!
		Welcome to my new webpage! For my assignment I need to write two long paragraphs so I can show and test some features of HTML web design. I really can’t think of a subject to write about so I’ll just talk about what’s on my mind at the moment. Right now I’m in a dilemma.. I don’t know whether to buy a guitar or a drum set. I’ve been a drummer for 20 years now, and I’ve sold my old kit since living in a condo. I now have no drum set and it drives me crazy. I’m not very good at guitar, but I play an acoustic now that I can’t play drums so I can satisfy my musical expression. However, since I’m not fluent at the guitar like I am at a drum set, I can’t bend the music to my emotion. It’s pure reciting and learning. With drums I could jump on and make it talk. I’d have stories in my head that I could paint in front of me and watch it unfold. Music, like painting or other forms of art have a lot of subliminal influences. When you’re literate at an instrument, you don’t always know what’s going to come out. There are surprises and hidden emotions.

		So in my condo I really cant play drums. I could buy an electric set and spend three to four thousand dollars, but the cymbals are terrible and lack any dynamic range of a real stick hitting metal. If I were going to spend that, I would much rather buy an <mark>AMAZING</mark> acoustic drum set – which I can’t have unless I rent space somewhere. With a top of the line electric guitar I could be two thousand dollars all in and the dynamic range is so much more. In fact, I’ve been toiling over this decision for weeks, and writing this out is really helping me make my decision. I’m going to buy a guitar now! The one I’m looking at? A Schecter Evil Twin or Schecter’s Reaper. The Reaper has a nice 7-string option, while the Evil Twin does not – as far as I know. Technology has really come a long way too! You now don’t have to buy a library of pedals for effects. You can buy a single pedal with a set amount of buttons and you can download different sounds and effects from online and assign them to the pedal board. That’s really nice. Well, thanks for reading this long on my random spewing of words. As stated before, this really helped me make a decision.

		In this assignment I need an ordered list with three items. The three items will be major guitar brands. 
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Schecter</li>
			<li>Gibson</li>
			<li>Jackson</li><br>
		</ol>
		
		
	    <p>
		I also need an unordered list with four items. The four items will be major drum brands. 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Mapex</li>
			<li>DW</li>
			<li>Pearl</li>
			<li>Tama</li>
		</ul>
